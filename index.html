        <h2>The Best Developer</h2>
        <p>
          The great thing about me is how I am the best. If you want the best,
          here I am. I develop in a way that defies explanation, or at the very
          least, I cannot explain it. I just do it because I'm that good. Take
          me, job daddy.

        <p>
          If you want someone who loves to be exploited by capitalism, you found
          that someone. Put dollars in my hand, and I will continue to rely on
          the socioeconomic system that props up your wealth. Please, dear god,
          hire me so that I don't have to do a revolution.
