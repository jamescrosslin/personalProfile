        <h2>The Best Developer</h2>
        <p>
          The great thing about me is how I am the best. If you want the best,
          here I am. I develop in a way that defies explanation, or at the very
          least, I cannot explain it. I just do it because I'm that good. Take
          me, job daddy.

          If you want someone who loves to be exploited by capitalism, you found
          that someone. Put dollars in my hand, and I will continue to rely on
          the socioeconomic system that props up your wealth.
